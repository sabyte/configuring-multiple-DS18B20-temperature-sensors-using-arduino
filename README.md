# configuring-multiple-DS18B20-temperature-sensors-using-arduino
There are so many examples available on the internet but none of them include more than 8 DS18B20 sensors. In one of my recent projects, I had to use 16 DS18B20 sensors for monitoring temperature and save the data in a SD card. I hope my project will come handy for people who need to use two one wire bus pins simultaneously.
